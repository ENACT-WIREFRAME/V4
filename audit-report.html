	</li><ul><li class="level2"><b>Obesity and inactivity </b>â€” people who are overweight or obese (especially central obesity)&nbsp;and/or have inactive lifestyles are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as overeating and inactivity can exacerbate insulin resistance. Obesity accounts for&nbsp;80â€“85% of the overall risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</li><li class="level2"><b>Family history </b>â€” type 2 diabetes tends to cluster in families. People with a family history of diabetes are 2â€“6&nbsp;times more likely to have diabetes than people without a family history. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 15% if one parent has type 2 diabetes and 75% if both parents have type 2 diabetes.</li><li class="level2"><b>Ethnicity </b>â€” people of Asian, African, and Black communities are 2â€“4 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people.</li><li class="level2"><b>History of gestational diabetes </b>â€” this confers a sevenfold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.&nbsp;Children born to mothers with gestational diabetes have a&nbsp;sixfold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</li><li class="level2">
		<b>Poor dietary habits </b>â€”low fibre, high glycaemic index (GI) diet&nbsp;may increase the risk of being overweight or obese, which in turn increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

		
		</li><ul><li class="level3">High-GI foods contain carbohydrates that&nbsp;are broken down quickly and cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels. Examples include sugary foods and drinks, white rice, white bread, and&nbsp;potatoes.</li></ul><li class="level2">
		<b>Drug treatments&nbsp;</b>â€”certain drug treatments, for example statins, corticosteroids, and combined treatment with a thiazide diuretic plus a beta-blocker, can increase the risk of developing hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes.

The GDG acknowledged the&nbsp;progressive nature of the condition and assumed that augmenting existing drug treatments with additional drugs will provide better blood glucose control as the&nbsp;added drug will have a different mode of action that is complementary to the existing drug treatment.</li><li class="level1">A series of 4 network meta-analyses (NMAs) were proposed for the NICE update, and the GDG agreed that the critical outcomes to consider were blood glucose control (change in HbA1c), hypoglycaemia, and adverse events, and an important outcome to consider was change in body weight.</li></ul><p><b>First-line treatment options</b></p><ul><li class="level1"><b>For people who can take metformin:</b>

	
	</li><ul><li class="level2">The NICE GDG discussed that although standard-release metformin was not associated with the greatest reduction in HbA1c in the reviewed evidence, the additional cardiovascular benefits associated with its use are very important in the overall long-term management of people with type 2 diabetes. In addition, metformin was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events and with weight loss at 12&nbsp;and 24 months, which are considered important for peopleâ€™s quality of life.</li><li class="level2">Although there was limited evidence on alternative forms of metformin for people who cannot tolerate the standard-release formulation, the GDG agreed that based on clinical experience, a trial of modified-release metformin should be considered as an alternative for people who are unable to tolerate standard-release metformin because of gastrointestinal adverse effects.&nbsp;</li></ul><li class="level1"><b>For people who cannot take metformin:</b>
	
	</li><ul><li class="level2">The GDG did not identify any studies that investigated the effects of different drug treatments in this group of people.&nbsp;</li><li class="level2">The GDG discussed the evidence surrounding the remaining drug interventions within the NMAs and agreed that in the absence of specific data on people for whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, the effectiveness of alternative treatments in the analyses should be extrapolated to inform equal treatment options, depending on tolerability.</li><li class="level2">In particular for sulfonylureas, which were associated with clinically important reductions in HbA1c in the short term at 3 and 6 months but were consistently associated with greater hypoglycaemic events and weight gain at 12 and 24 months, the&nbsp;GDG recommended that the balance of good blood glucose control and the risk of poor weight outcomes and hypoglycaemia should be considered (and discussed with the person) before treatment is started and that treatment should be reviewed once agreed targets have been met.</li></ul></ul><p><b>Second-line treatment options&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li class="level1"><b>For people who can take metformin:</b></li><li class="level1">Metformin plus a gliptin was moderately effective in controlling blood glucose levels and was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events and weight loss.</li><li class="level1">Metformin plus pioglitazone was most effective at reducing HbA1c levels at 24 months and preventing nausea, but was associated with weight gain.</li><li class="level1">Metformin plus a sulfonylurea was moderately effective in reducing HbA1c levels but was strongly associated with more hypoglycaemic events.</li><li class="level1"><b>For people who cannot take metformin:</b>

	</li><ul><li class="level2">Metoclopramide has well-known risks of neurological effects, such as short-term extrapyramidal disorders and tardive dyskinesia; therefore, it should be prescribed for short-term use only (up to 5 days) and at a maximum daily dose of 30 mg (usual dose of 10 mg up to three times a day)&nbsp;[<a rel="citation" resource="1090203#A79645" href="/diabetes-type-2#!references/1090203">MHRA, 2014b</a>].</li><li class="level2">Domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious cardiac adverse effects (such as ventricular arrhythmias, QT interval prolongation, and sudden cardiac death), especially in people older than 60 years of age, people taking daily oral domperidone doses of more than 30 mg, and people taking QT-prolonging drugs (such as erythromycin) or CYP3A4 inhibitors at the same time as domperidone.&nbsp;The maximum treatment duration should not usually exceed one week&nbsp;[<a rel="citation" resource="1090203#A79644" href="/diabetes-type-2#!references/1090203">MHRA, 2014c</a>].</li><li class="level2">The NICE GDG recommends alternating treatment with erythromycin and metoclopramide but does not provide any information on how this should be done (including information on the dose or duration of treatment).&nbsp;CKS therefore recommends seeking specialist advice if a prokinetic drug is being considered for an adult with vomiting caused by gastroparesis.</li></ul><li class="level1">The GDG discussed that the differential diagnosis of gastroparesis can be challenging, and that serious prolonged vomiting could become a medical emergency. Accordingly, specialist referral is sometimes indicated.&nbsp;
	
	</li><ul><li class="level2">Whilst the GDG gave priority to drug treatments for the management of this condition, clinical experience suggested that non-pharmacological approaches, including timing of ingestion of fluids and solids, could be useful to some people.</li></ul></ul><p><b>Managing other aspects of autonomic neuropathy</b></p><ul><li class="level1">The NICE GDG extrapolated these recommendations from the NICE&nbsp;guideline&nbsp;on type 1&nbsp;diabetes in adults&nbsp;[<a rel="citation" resource="1090203#A1295090" href="/diabetes-type-2#!references/1090203">NICE, 2015d</a>].</li></ul><p><b>Managing erectile dysfunction</b></p><ul><li class="level1">The NICE GDG reviewed the available evidence to determine whether&nbsp;pharmacological treatment (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors,&nbsp;alprostredil, and/or testosterone therapy)&nbsp;should be used to manage erectile dysfunction in men with type 2&nbsp;diabetes.</li><li class="level1">For&nbsp;phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors:

The European Medicines Agency has issued the following advice to minimise the risk of such effects when treating patients with a SGLT2 inhibitor:
	
	</li><ul><li class="level2">Test for raised ketones in patients presenting with symptoms of DKA, even if plasma glucose levels are near-normal; omitting this test could delay a diagnosis of DKA.</li><li class="level2">Discontinue treatment if DKA is suspected.</li><li class="level2">If DKA is confirmed, take appropriate measures to correct the DKA and monitor glucose levels.</li><li class="level2">Patients should be advised on how to recognise the signs and symptoms of DKA such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness, and to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of DKA develop.</li></ul></ul><p>

            <b>Increased risk of volume depletion</b>
          </p><ul><li class="level1">Based on the mode of action of SGLT-2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic glycosuria may lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom a drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older.</li><li class="level1">In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving SGLT-2i medication. Temporary interruption of treatment should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.</li></ul><p>

							<li>Assess local practice against NICE guidelines</li>
							<li>Compare their care and care outcomes with similar services and organisations</li>
							<li>Identify gaps or shortfalls that are priorities for improvement</li>
							<li>Identify and share best practice</li>
							<li>Provide comprehensive national pictures of diabetes care and outcomes in England and Wales</li>
						    </ul>Through participation in the audit, local services are able to benchmark their performance and identify where they are performing well and improve the quality of treatment and care they provide.<p></p>

					<p>I had struggled to keep my diabetes under control for over a year. I was taking medication already and seriously trying to improve my diet.  My Mum lost her sight because of diabetes and I was worried that this might happen to me.  My doctor prescribed me another medicine and suggested I try it for a while to see if it made an improvement.</p>
					<p>Although I had doubts about starting another medicine, Iâ€™m glad that I did because my blood sugar is better now and I havenâ€™t had any bad side effects. I know that doctors sometimes donâ€™t want to push lots of medicines onto people with diabetes but it is only fair to the patient that they ask.</p>
